function l = draw_links(link_set,link_colors,ax)
% Draw a set of lines for a link structure into a specified axis
%
% Inputs:
%
%   link_set: A 1xn cell array, each entry of which is a matrix whose
%       columns are the endpoints of the lines describing one link of the
%       system (as constructed by planar_build_links or
%       planar_build_links_prismatic
%   link_colors: 1x3 cell array. Each entry can be either a standard matlab
%       color string (e.g., 'k' or 'r') or a 1x3 vector of the RGB values
%       for the color (range from 0 to 1)
%   ax: The handle to an axis in which to plot the links
%
% Output:
%
%   l: A cell array of the same size as link_set, in which each entry is a
%       handle to a line structure for that link


    %%%%%%%%
    % Start by creating an empty cell array of the same size as link_set,
    % named 'l'

    l = cell(size(link_set));

    %%%%%%%%
    % Draw a line for each link, with circles at the endpoints, and save
    % the handle for this line in the corresponding element of 'l'

    for idx = 1:numel(l)
        
        l{idx} = line(ax,link_set{idx}(1,:),link_set{idx}(2,:),'color',link_colors{idx},'Marker','O');
