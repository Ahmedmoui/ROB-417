% Construct a translation-rotation Jacobian for a chain of links as a
% function of the link vectors, the joint angles, joint axes, and the
% number of the link whose endpoint is the location where the Jacobian is
% evaluated, *and expressed in the frame of the link*
%
% Inputs:
%
%   link_vectors: A 1xn cell array in which each entry is a 3x1 link vector
%   joint_angles: a nx1 vector, each element of which is the joint angle
%       preceeding the corresponding link
%   joint_axes: a nx1 cell array, each entry of which is 'x','y', or 'z',
%       designating the axis of the corresponding joint
%   link_number: The number of the link whose Jacobian we want to evaluate
%
% Output:
%
%   J: The translation-rotation Jacobian for the end of link 'link_number',
%       with respect to *all* joint angles (all columns of J corresponding
%       to joints after the link should be zeros) *and expressed in the j.

% Additional outputs (These are intermediate variables. Having the option
%   to return them as outputs lets our automatic code checker tell you
%   where problems are in your code):
%
%   link_ends: a 3x(n+1) matrix, whose first column is the location
%       of the base of the first link (which should be at the origin), and
%       whose remaining columns are the endpoints of the links
%   link_end_set: The endpoints of the links after taking the cumulative
%       sum of link vectors
%   link_end_set_with_base: The endpoints of the links after taking the cumulative
%       sum of link vectors, with a zero point added at the beginning
%   v_diff: The set of vectors from all points in 'link_end_set_with_base'
%       to the end of link 'link_number'
%   joint_axis_vectors: The unit vectors pointing along each joint axis in
%       local coordinates
%   joint_axis_vectors_R: The unit vectors pointing along each joint axis
%       in world coordinates
%   R_links: The orientations of the individual links
%   J_translational: The translational component of the Jacobian

    % First, use arm_Jacobian to get the translation Jacobian for link
    % 'link_number' and the 'joint_axis_vectors_R' for the chain. Call the
    % Jacobian calculated here 'J_translational'
